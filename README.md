This is the github repository for the paper [Error Correcting Output Codes Improve Probability Estimation and Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9070-error-correcting-output-codes-improve-probability-estimation-and-adversarial-robustness-of-deep-neural-networks.pdf) by Gunjan Verma and Ananthram Swami.

All code is in Python 3.6 using PyTorch. Adversarial attacks are done with CleverHans 3.0.1.
This is an unofficial port of the official [Tensorflow + PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/Gunjan108/robust-ecoc)
